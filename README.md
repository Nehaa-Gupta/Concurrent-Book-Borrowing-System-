Concurrent-Book-Borrowing-System
<br>
Problem Statement: 
<br>
We’re building a digital portal for a library. To start off, we have two basic
 entities in the picture, that is, the library and the customers. The first assignment will look at
 some rudimentary operations:
 1. Borrow book
 2. Return book
<br>
 This is quite simple. You are provided a queue class for the book requests that come in.
 Furthermore, you have to maintain a linked list of pending requests, that is, books which couldn’t
 be lent due to someone else already having borrowed them.
